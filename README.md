# UCI Montesinho Park Forest Fires

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the **UCI Montesinho Park Forest Fires** dataset. The dataset is used to predict forest fire occurrences and severity based on meteorological and geographical data. The primary focus of this project is to explore, visualize, and apply machine learning techniques to understand the patterns of forest fires.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains multiple environmental variables, including:
- Temperature (°C)
- Relative Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Rainfall (mm/m²)
- Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)
- Duff Moisture Code (DMC)
- Drought Code (DC)
- Fire Weather Index (FWI)

## Project Structure
- **UCI_Montesinho_Park_Forest_Fires.ipynb** - The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
- **README.md** - This documentation file explaining the project.
